      "This coffee is one of Cat & Cloud’s year-round favorites, grown in Brazil’s ancient volcanic valley of Vale de Grama and given a unique “pulped natural” processing. This method was pioneered in Brazil and is similar to natural processing except the skin of the coffee cherry is removed before drying, leaving just the pulp around the bean and resulting in a sweet full-bodied yet clean tasting cup. Cat & Cloud found notes of peanut butter and jelly in this coffee, but it was more like peanut M&Ms on our end. We tasted milk chocolate, peanut, honey, a lime acidity and a tea-like body.",

We were going to brew this as a pour-over too, but the espresso was so good we had to stop right there. May return to pour-over later.",
